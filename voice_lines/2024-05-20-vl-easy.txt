After Trackmania Driver 19101 composed themselves,
they looked up to behold the tower, standing proud, silhouetted against the setting sun...
The *monster* had been conquered.

Brimming with a sense of accomplishment, the driver knew:
All those hours had finally paid off.
It truly had been an afternoon well spent.

To think, Trackmania Driver 19101 had summited
the most challenging Trackmania map ever built,
and with so little practice at the game, too!

"I must be one dang hot gamer!" thought the driver.
"This game doesn't seem so hard after all...
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about."

But then, a new thought entered their mind...

"This tower... it looks kind of wrong..."
"Kind of... unfinished..."
and the doubts started to creep in.

Mind reeling, their eyes glace to the map name
and suddenly the driver freezes.

Yes, Trackmania Driver 19101, you are correct.
That *is* what '[E]' means.

The _easy_ version.

You have a choice, now that you know the truth.

You can leave the game, now, if you want.
Go back to your life, knowing that you conquered Deep Dip 2 [E].
The story ends, you uninstall Trackmania, and believe whatever you want to believe.

Or you can choose to stay,
to try the *real* map,
and see how far the deep dip goes.
