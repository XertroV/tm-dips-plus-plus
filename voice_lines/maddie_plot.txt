# maddie's journey
- start as passive observer, need to step in
- become involved, take interest, 02
  - dialog: show interest, tease things, donor comedy line, reveal dad, bond with player, some bg on context of caller
- 3. begin questioning:
  - what? how does progress interact?
- 4. (rest of philosophical journey)

- plax floor (13) line


* lakanta guy -> analogy to sisiphus -> nobility via integrity of goal and seeking it




maddie evolution:

- why do this? over and over?

- thoughts on truth in hard things

- thoughts on endurance of our efforts

- does it matter if people watch?
  - not the act of streaming, that's how you make a living
  - but would you play if no body knew? Is there a point to great achievements if no one can see them? (tree in the forest acknowledgement)
    - books can be read centuries later, right now doesn't define everything. artists whose works are only discovered after they die.
    - does purpose need a payoff?
    - maybe sometimes purpose means you never see the payoff, but you do it anyway.

- purpose and ephemerality
  - can something be meaningful if it doesn't endure?
  - examples: the winning run, the effect on / change in you & others,
  - purpose must be linked to change -- creation and error-correction, conjecture and refutation, to carve and sculpt (sometimes carving our sculptures or sculpting our carvings),

  - doing the hard thing first

  - what is good and bad?
  - easy for simple things: objective quality that it works
  - but what about our life and goals?
  - good/bad can't be deduced for our life/purpose like it can for a spoon, has to come from somewhere
  - is that what values are? like maybe they're axioms we choose to judge our actions
  - but our choice of values also can work or not work
    - like contradictions, they break values
    - consistency
  - so are there objective values?
  - why values are a choice, and must be a choice

  - why things persist (knowledge: it works, life: it lives, art, buildings, culture, )
  - rational and anti-rational memes

  - what about things that are never done -- impossible journeys like play every map on tmx.

- what are you going to do once you get to the top?
  - when the goal is over
  - will you wake up the next day feeling empty?
  - where does the drive come from to keep going?

- despair - the size, the difficulty
- self reflection of existence
- feeling dread if the player finishes
- if you never finish, I'll always be here, but if you do, what happens to Dad and I? I'm scared
-
- resoluton: maddie understands she needs to leave to seek her own metaphorical tower to climb, she's scared but hopeful,



- can one be satisfied with being a link in a great chain? a journey so long that you can't see either end?
- or do people need to invent a world for themselves that puts them in a privileged / special position?
- i guess in some ways both are the same because we could ruin everything, that's the power and danger of being human, being part of something bigger.
- would we sabotage that?
- should i make decisions for the sake of those other people, though? who are they even? would they want to inherit the responsibility of knowing i lived my life for them? who do they live their life for?
- go too far down this line of thinking and we end up with a world where no one lives for themselves, and no one understands why we do anything.
- so it must be that it's right to put yourself first in your own life. like if you don't prioritize your own life then who will? and if no one does, how long will you last?
- who did our great ancestors live for?

- wherever we're going, it has to be up and out -- otherwise we go nowhere.

- how can an unfinishable journey achieve anything?



* maybe maddie lies to the player at some point, and has to deal with that. Well she lies to her dad a bit

* maybe dad leaves for a bit, maddie alone


company plot:
- working up to the big broadcast, so like showing the shareholders how great this is going to be
- why broadcast: it's a great event and achievement
- people want to see greatness, it's inspiring, exciting, and reminds us how possible great things are when we persevere
- we need great people, great achievements, great ideas, to see them with our own eyes. how else can anyone learn to surpass their ancestors?
- if we don't surpass our ancestors... what are we living for? just to die?
-

- who builds this stuff and why?
