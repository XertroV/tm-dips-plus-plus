Uhh Hello. Shame about that. Soooo... umm, we haven't met before, but I'm standing in for Cecil while he takes a break. Umm don't worry, he'll be back soon. In the mean time.... ahh yes, the next line. Found it. It says: *clears through* to proceed, you must go up. Oh, uhh do you know what that means? To be honest I'm a bit new, it's my first day, so if you have any ideas that would be great. ... Thanks. ... In advance I guess, because, well I mean you haven't really responded this whole time but I wonder how Cecil does it. Like does he just say stuff when things happen and that's it? Like no feedback? I don't know. *sigh* it would be nice to you know talk to you a bit. ... Okay, well good luck up there.



Hey, so uhh dad's away at the moment, and I'm meant to let him know if you fall, but i've been watching you fall for LITERALLY hours and wen you do he says some stupid line like *Deep Dip 2: Circle of Dipsterbation* and like to be honest it's pretty lame. Like, you're doing one of the LITERALLY hardest things to do, line in the world, and... well for one that's really impressive, and... I believe in you. It's the destinations we seek that make us who we are, not the falls we take along the way. .. Good luck up there. .. I gotta go.

hey so uhh dads on break again and.. well look I have heard of this plax guy who made floor 13 and... well i mean i don't think he plays fair, you know? like it's a bit off... Like it's normal not to finish it first try. Don't worry about it, we're all still rooting for you.... it would help if you didn't fall though.
