0: Hey, it's me again. Cecil had to step out for a minute. You were doing so well! We both thought you'd be okay not to fall *there*, of all places.
9303: (*excited*) Oh, by the way, I've been watching a bit and I think I get what's going on now. Like, when you fall, he presses some buttons and says one of the things on these cards. He's got like... hundreds of them, all over the desk.
23060: (*quizzically*) Not sure what the other papers are for, though. ...
25680: Probably something to do with the calls.
27908: Anyway, Dad, uhh.. I mean Cecil... uhh he had the next one ready.
34328: It says: Deep Dip 2: donors to the prize pool are featured on the in-game signs and in the openplanet plugin! oh uhh.. that might not have been the right card. ...
48282: Uhh can I ask a favor? Could you umm maybe.. not.. mention this to Dad? Like it can just be between us? He's been working really hard on this, and I don't want him to get distracted because I read the wrong thing.
62105: I mean it's not like it really matters, like he hasn't told me what buttons to press to do what he normally does, so.. I mean, he needs to wait for the next fall *anyway*. ...
74355: Uhh, you couldn't, like... finish floor 1 real quick, could you? It would just make it a lot easier if I said you only fell *most* of the way down. Or if you hang out here for a minute or two I'm sure he'll come back soon.
89423: Uhh speaking of, I should probably go.
93884: (*whispers*) okay, good luck.
