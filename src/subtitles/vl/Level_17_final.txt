Congratulations, you've done it!
The metaphorical Everest,
you made it to the top!
You were willing to fail and because of that you have achieved something not many will ever accomplish.
You have conquered Deep Dip Two.
I can't imagine what you went through to get here, but you get to tell the best story of all.
Now go celebrate, you've earned it.
